# AirPurifier
The aim of this project is to help with monitoring of indoor air quality using a smart air purifier. The device can be controlled via a web application over the internet.
Components used for this project are: NodeMCU, MQ135 gas sensor, and LED light. The LED light is used instead of a fan that would start when the air quality is poor.
The project consists of 3 parts: the control side - a web application through which the user controls the device, the Internet side - real-time database, created using the Firebase system, through which the control side communicates with the executive side - which consists of the previously mentioned components.
